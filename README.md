# ShotGrid Toolkit Engine for Adobe Substance 3D Painter

A ShotGrid engine for Adobe Substance 3D Painter that enables seamless integration with your VFX/animation pipeline.

## Features

- **Project Management**: Create and manage Substance Painter projects through the Shotgun Workfiles app
- **Publishing**: Publish both `.spp` project files and exported texture sets to Shotgun
- **Multi-App Support**: Integrates with standard Shotgun apps (Workfiles2, Publisher, Breakdown, etc.)

## Requirements

- Adobe Substance 3D Painter (version 12 or higher recommended)
- Shotgun Toolkit
- Python 3.7+
- A configured Shotgun pipeline (based on `tk-config-default2`)

## Installation

Add the engine location to your pipeline configuration in `env/includes/engine_locations.yml`:

```yaml
engines.tk-substancepainter.location:
  type: git
  path: https://github.com/dovanbel/tk-substancepainter.git
  version: v1.0.1 # Update to the latest available tag from this repo
```

## Configuration

The following sections provide configuration examples for a pipeline based on [tk-config-default2](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-config-default2). Customize these to fit your studio's needs.

### Templates Configuration

Add these template definitions to `core/templates.yml`:

```yaml
    asset_root: Assets/{sg_asset_type}/{Asset}/{Step}
    
    substancepainter_asset_root: '@asset_root/substancepainter'

    substancepainter_asset_project_work_area:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_root/projects/work'
    substancepainter_asset_project_publish_area:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_root/projects/publish'
    substancepainter_asset_texture_work_area:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_root/export/work'
    substancepainter_asset_texture_publish_area:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_root/export/publish'

    # WIP project files

    substancepainter_asset_publish:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_project_publish_area/{Asset}_{task_name}_{name}_v{version}.spp'
    
    # Project snapshots
    substancepainter_asset_snapshot:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_project_work_area/snapshots/{Asset}_{task_name}_{name}_v{version}_{timestamp}.spp'
    
    # Published texture files
    substancepainter_asset_texture_publish:
        definition: '@substancepainter_asset_texture_publish_area/{texture_set}_v{version}/{Asset}_{task_name}_{texture_set}_{texture_map}_{colorspace}_v{version}.{extension}'

```

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Launch Substance Painter from Shotgun Desktop
2. The engine will initialize and display the Shotgun menu in the application

### Creating a New Project

1. Select **File Open** from the Shotgun menu
2. The Workfiles app will open
3. Navigate to the texturing task for your asset
4. Click **+ New File**
5. Configure the "New Substance Project" dialog:
   - Select the mesh to texture
   - Choose a Substance Painter template (optional)
   - Set document resolution
   - Configure normal map format
   - Set tangent space calculation method
   - Enable UV Tiles (UDIMs) if needed (⚠️ **cannot be changed later**)
6. Save your project using **File Save** from the Shotgun menu

### Scene Breakdown

The Scene Breakdown app (`tk-multi-breakdown2`) monitors your project's mesh references and will allow you to update the mesh

### Loader

**Note:** The Loader app is configured but not implemented in v1.0.1. The configuration is required as `tk-multi-breakdown2` depends on it.

### Publishing

The Publisher handles two types of publishes:

#### 1. Project File Publishing

Publishes the `.spp` project file to Shotgun, similar to standard session publishing in other DCCs.

#### 2. Texture Publishing

Exports and publishes texture sets.

#### Export Preset System

Due to limitations in the Substance Painter Python API, this engine uses a custom export preset workflow:

**How It Works:**

1. **Base Preset**: The engine includes a "Shotgrid_base" export preset (located in `resources/export-presets/`)
2. **Auto-Installation**: On first launch of the engine, this preset is copied to your Substance Painter documents directory
3. **Preservation**: The engine won't overwrite existing presets, allowing you to customize them
4. **Naming Convention**: Use presets starting with "Shotgrid..." to make them available for publishing

**Required Filename Pattern for all texture maps:**

```
$textureSet_<MapName>_$colorSpace(.$udim)
```

Where:
- `$textureSet` - Substance Painter variable for texture set name
- `<MapName>` - Your custom map name (e.g., BaseColor, Roughness, Normal)
  - ⚠️ **Do not use spaces or underscores in map names**
- `$colorSpace` - Substance Painter variable for color space
- `(.$udim)` - Optional UDIM suffix for tiled workflows

**Customization:**

- Add additional texture maps to the "Shotgrid_base" preset as needed
- Duplicate the preset to create variations (ensure the name starts with "Shotgrid")
- Select your preferred preset from the dropdown in the Publisher UI

**Publishing Process:**

1. **Validation**: Checks that filename patterns match the required format
2. **Export**: Textures are exported to a work folder using the selected preset
3. **Publishing**: Files are copied and renamed according to the publish template to the publish location with version numbers
4. **Database**: Each texture map is registered as a PublishedFile in Shotgun
5. **Texture Set**: A parent PublishedFile is created linking all texture maps together

The published texture set can be used downstream in other DCCs (e.g., automatically assigning textures to shader slots in Maya via a custom loader action).

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Platform Support
- **Tested on**: Windows only
- **Untested**: macOS and Linux (configuration provided but requires validation)

### UI Styling
There are visual issues with app interfaces in v1.0.1:
- Some buttons appear overly bright
- Font readability issues in certain dialogs
- Similar to historical issues with `tk-houdini`

Contributions to resolve these styling issues are welcome!

### Loader Implementation
The Loader app is not fully implemented. To add functionality:
- Explore the `substance_painter.resource` module in the Python API
- Implement custom loader actions as needed

### Software Entity System
- The provided configuration uses YAML-based software paths
- Software Entity system (defining paths in Shotgun) is untested but should work

## Testing and Stability

⚠️ **Version v1.0.1 is freshly released**
- Expect potential bugs and edge cases
- Test thoroughly in a development environment before production use
- Report issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dovanbel/tk-substancepainter/issues)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas where help would be particularly valuable:
- UI styling fixes
- macOS and Linux testing
- Loader app implementation
- Documentation improvements
